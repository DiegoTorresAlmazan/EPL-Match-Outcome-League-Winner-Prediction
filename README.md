# EPL-Match-Outcome-League-Winner-Prediction
This project predicts match outcomes across the English Premier League using machine learning and simulates full seasons to estimate league winner probabilities.

The EPL was chosen because it offers:
-High-quality, publicly available historical match data
-Long, consistent season history
-Strong competitive balance, making prediction non-trivial
-Relevance to real-world sports analytics and forecasting problems
-Focusing on a single league ensures cleaner modeling assumptions and allows for deeper feature engineering and evaluation.
